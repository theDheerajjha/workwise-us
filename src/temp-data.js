              'Navy OGC welcomes applications from law students and practicing attorneys. Recent law school graduates may also apply, if the candidate has taken the bar examination and is awaiting the results. Navy OGC recruits each year at law schools and consortiums across the country. Also, individual OGC offices often recruit through law schools in their region for local openings. We always welcome inquiries from students at other schools that we\'re not able to visit. Each year, a number of second-year students apply for and are selected to participate in our Summer Law Clerk Program. Our clerks have an opportunity to undertake a variety of projects and visit naval activities, such as the Naval Air Station or board a Navy ship. Each fall, a number of offers ("advance commitments") are made to third-year students who have served as summer law clerks. These "advance commitments," will begin work after they have completed law school and after taking the bar exam. This position is in the Excepted Service and does not confer competitive status. ICTAP does not apply to Excepted Service positions. This announcement may be used to fill additional vacancies. Relocation expenses may or may not be authorized. A tentative offer of employment will be rescinded if the selectee fails to meet the pre-employment requirements, including failure to report to any of the scheduled appointments. The Department of the Navy uses E-Verify to confirm the employment eligibility of all newly hired employees.

        QualificationSummary:
          "YOU MUST MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR 10-POINT VETERANS PREFERENCE TO BE CONSIDERED. VETERANS PREFERENCE Veterans preference gives eligible veterans preference in hiring. Preference is given in competitive appointments as well as special noncompetitive appointments. Only veterans discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge) are eligible for veterans preference. There are three types of preference eligible: Disabled, regardless of the rating; Non-Disabled; and Sole survivorship preference The preference eligibles are divided into five basic groups: CPS - Disability rating of 30% or more (10 points) CP - Disability rating of at least 10% but less than 30% (10 points) XP - Disability rating less than 10% (10 points) TP - Preference eligibles with no disability rating (5 points) SSP - Sole Survivorship Preference (0 points) This announcement is only accepting application from disabled, 10-point veterans with CPS, CP, or XP preference. Other preference groups (TP and SSP) may apply to our VRA-specific announcement to avoid being found ineligible. For more information on the types of veterans preference, visit the Feds Hire Vets Veterans Preference web page. SPECIAL HIRING AUTHORITIES FOR VETERANS Below is a list of special hiring authorities designed specifically for veterans for which 10-point veterans may be eligible. For more information, visit the Feds Hire Vets Special Hiring Authorities for Veterans web page. Veterans Recruitment Act (VRA) VRA allows for the appointment of eligible veterans without competition from non veterans. This hiring authority can be used for positions up to GS-11 or equivalent. Veterans are hired under excepted appointments to positions that are otherwise found in competitive service. After the individual satisfactorily completes 2 years of service, the veteran must be converted non-competitively to a career or career-conditional appointment. Eligibility under the VRA hiring authority applies to any of the following veterans: Disabled veterans; or Veterans who served in active duty in the Armed Forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or Veterans who, while serving on active duty in the armed forces, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded; or Recently separated veterans (within 3 years). In addition, veterans must be separated from the Armed Forces under honorable or general discharge. 30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans The 30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans authority enables the appointment of an eligible candidate to any position for which he or she is qualified without competition. Unlike the VRA, there is no grade-level limitation. Initial appointments are time-limited, lasting more than 60 days; however, individuals can be non-competitively converted to a permanent status at any time during the time-limited appointment. Eligibility applies to the following categories: Disabled veterans who were retired from active military service with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more; or Disabled veterans rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program Disabled veterans eligible for training under the Veterans Administration (VA) vocational rehabilitation program may enroll for training or work experience at an agency under the terms of an agreement between the agency and VA. While enrolled in the VA program, the veteran is not a Federal employee for most purposes, but is a beneficiary of the VA. Training is tailored to the individual's needs and goals, so there is no set length. If the training is intended to prepare the individual for eventual appointment in the agency rather than just provide work experience, the agency must ensure that the training will enable the veteran to meet the qualification requirements for the position. Upon successful completion, the host agency and VA give the veteran a Certificate of Training showing the occupational series and grade level of the position for which the veteran trained. The Certificate of Training allows any agency to appoint the veteran non-competitively under a status quo appointment which may be converted to career or career conditional at any time. Applicants wishing to be considered for employment using SSA's competitive selection process may also respond to a specific job opportunity announcement listed on SSA's job opportunity page at: https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/Results?a=SZ00&hp=public&p=1",
